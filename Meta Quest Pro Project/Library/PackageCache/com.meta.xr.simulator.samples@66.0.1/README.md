Meta XR Simulator is a lightweight OpenXR runtime built for developers and enables you to simulate Meta VR devices and features on the API level. It makes day-to-day development easier by enabling you to test and debug your apps without needing to don and doff your headset every time, and helps scale automation by simplifying your testing environment setup.

This package specifically includes some sample VR assets to help you get started with Meta XR Simulator. The Meta XR Core SDK package is required in order to use some of the assets.

Note: Meta XR Simulator is still experimental. We are continuing to improve its usability and add useful features. A stable version will be released in the second half of 2023.
